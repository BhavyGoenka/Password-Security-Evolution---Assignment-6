# Password Security Evolution Assignment-6
A security lab task demonstrating the creation and evaluation of passwords using online strength checkers, along with best practices and insights into password attacks.
Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength  

## Objective  
To understand what makes a password strong, evaluate different passwords using an online password strength checker, and summarize best practices for creating secure passwords.  

## Tools Used  
- Online password strength checker: [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com)  

## Step 1: Password Creation  
I created 4 sample passwords with different levels of complexity:  
- simple
- Password
- Pa$$w0rd! 
- !Nf0Syst3m#Lab@2025 

## Step 2: Password Strength Evaluation  
- simple → Score: Very Weak (Too short, only lowercase + no numbers, easily guessable).  
- Password → Score: Weak (Common dictionary word, predictable pattern).  
- Pa$$w0rd! → Score: Strong (Includes symbols, but still based on “password”).  
- !Nf0Syst3m#Lab@2025 → Score: Very Strong (Long, mixed character types, unique, not dictionary-based).  

## Step 3: Best Practices Identified  
- Use at least 12–16 characters.  
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.  
- Avoid dictionary words and common phrases.  
- Create unpredictable and random patterns.  
- Use passphrases instead of single words.  
- Never reuse the same password across accounts.  

## Step 4: Research on Common Password Attacks  
- *Brute Force Attack:* Tries all possible combinations until the correct one is found. Longer passwords take much more time to crack.  
- *Dictionary Attack:* Uses lists of common words or phrases. Avoid dictionary words to stay safe.  
- *Credential Stuffing:* Attackers use leaked username-password pairs from other sites. Unique passwords protect against this.  
- *Phishing:* Even strong passwords can be stolen if entered on fake websites. Awareness is important.  

## Step 5: Conclusion  
- Password complexity directly impacts resistance against attacks.  
- Weak passwords can be cracked in seconds, while strong ones may take years.  
- The best strategy is to create long, random, unique passwords and store them securely in a password manager.  

## Final Tips Learned  
- Longer is stronger (12–16+ characters).  
- Always mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.  
- Avoid obvious words like "password," "admin," or your name.  
- Use passphrases for memorability and strength.  
- Do not reuse the same password across different accounts.  
- Use a password manager for safe storage.  

*Outcome:* I learned how to create and evaluate strong passwords, why complexity matters, and how to protect against common password attacks.
